# Old Frugal Mechanic Repositories

FrugalMechanic was a comparison shopping site for automotive parts that operated from 2008 to ~2019. It was run by ([@tpunder](https://github.com/tpunder)) and ([@er1c](https://github.com/er1c)). The domain expired and was taken over by a spammer so I won't reference it here.

I ([@tpunder](https://github.com/tpunder)) have moved all of the old Frugal Mechanic open source over to my personal GitHub account:
